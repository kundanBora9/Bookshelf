 
First, I design the page, including the input field and the My Bookshelf button.
After designing, I use state in the input field to handle data, followed by fetching it in JSON format.Then, I search for a result state that will assist me in storing data received via Api, such as the object name book, which is printed in the format book.book_title, and other information required for that data. Once the thing has been developed and is working properly. I move on to the add to bookshelf button because when I click it, the page should transmit data to my bookshelf page, which I developed using props. Then In App.jsx, using state, I handle the data coming from the header.jsx with the aid of react dom, I transmit data through bookshelf, and then in mybookshelf, I call that property, which helps me receive that data, and the test works well.but wasting time when fatching the name of the books over 5 seconds.
